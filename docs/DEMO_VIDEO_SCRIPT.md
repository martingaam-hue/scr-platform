# SCR Platform — Product Demo Video Script

**Format:** Narrated screen walkthrough
**Target Duration:** 8–10 minutes
**Tone:** Confident, specific, unhurried — let the product speak
**Audience:** Fund managers, investment analysts, LPs, institutional investors
**Version:** 1.0 | March 2026

---

## PRE-PRODUCTION NOTES

- Record at 2× resolution, deliver at 1080p or 4K
- Use a clean demo environment with pre-seeded realistic data (no "Test Project 1")
- Seed data should use plausible project names: Helios Solar Portfolio Iberia, Nordvik Wind Farm II, Adriatic Infrastructure Holdings
- Voiceover recorded separately, laid over screen capture
- Background music: minimal, low-key — stop completely during any AI output moments so results land silently
- Cursor movements: slow and deliberate, never jerky
- Highlight clicks with a subtle pulse animation
- Text overlays: Calibri or Inter, dark navy, white background pill — appear 0.5s after the thing they label
- Total cuts between scenes: use smooth cross-dissolves, not hard cuts

## OPENING TITLE CARD

**[0:00 – 0:12]**

*[Black screen. White text fades in centre-frame.]*

> **"Every week, a fund manager loses a deal because their due diligence took too long."**

*[Text fades. Replaced by:]*

> **"Every quarter, an LP receives a report that took their analyst two weeks to assemble."**

*[Text fades. Replaced by:]*

> **"Every day, a covenant breach builds — undetected — in a spreadsheet no one is watching."**

*[Beat. Then:]*

> **"SCR Platform."**

*[Logo resolves. Subtitle appears: "The AI-Native Operating System for Sustainable Infrastructure Investment"]*

---

## ACT 1 — THE PLATFORM (Dashboard Overview)

**[0:12 – 1:00]**

*[Fade from title card to the SCR dashboard, already logged in as a fund manager at a fictional firm "Meridian Capital Partners"]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "This is the SCR Platform — a single operating system for every stage of the investment lifecycle. From the first deal screen to LP reporting, every workflow lives here. Let's walk through it."

*[Camera slowly pans across the dashboard. Show KPI cards at top: Active Deals, Portfolio IRR, Covenants Monitored, Documents Processed.]*

*[Text overlay appears on each card as narrator mentions it.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "The dashboard gives the fund manager an instant read on what matters: where deals stand in the pipeline, how the portfolio is performing against benchmark, and whether any covenant needs attention today. Every number here is live — not a weekly extract, not a manually refreshed spreadsheet."

*[Sidebar is visible on left. Slowly scroll down it to show the navigation depth: Portfolio, Deal Pipeline, Data Room, Risk & Compliance, Reports, AI — Ralph.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "The platform covers 81 distinct modules — from deal origination and due diligence, through portfolio monitoring and covenant tracking, to automated LP reporting. We'll walk through the ones that matter most."

---

## ACT 2 — SIGNAL SCORE™

**[1:00 – 2:30]**

*[Navigate to Projects → click into "Helios Solar Portfolio Iberia"]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Start with how the platform evaluates a deal. Every project on SCR receives a Signal Score — an AI-calculated viability rating that tells an investor, in a single number, how investment-ready this project is."

*[Signal Score page loads. Show the score gauge prominently — let's say 74 out of 100.]*

*[Text overlay: "Signal Score™ — 74 / 100"]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Seventy-four out of one hundred. But the number alone tells you nothing. The value is in what's underneath it."

*[Click into the score breakdown. Six dimension bars animate in one by one: Project Viability, Financial Planning, ESG & Impact, Risk Assessment, Team Strength, Market Opportunity.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Six dimensions. Forty-eight specific criteria. The platform has read every document in this project's data room — financial models, technical studies, legal agreements, ESG reports — and assessed each criterion against its standard. The bar chart shows exactly where this project is strong and where it needs work."

*[Hover over Financial Planning — tooltip shows sub-scores for Revenue Model, Capital Stack, DSCR Analysis.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Hover into any dimension and you see the criterion-level breakdown. This project scores well on its revenue model and PPA structure — but the debt service coverage analysis hasn't been uploaded yet. That's what's holding the financial planning score down."

*[Click "Gap Analysis" tab. A prioritised improvement list appears.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "The Gap Analysis turns the score into an action plan. Here the platform has identified that uploading the DSCR analysis would add nine points to the financial planning dimension — the single highest-impact action this developer can take today."

*[Click "What Changed?" timeline. Show three historical score events with explanations.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "And every score change is explained. Three weeks ago, the team uploaded the grid connection study — that added eleven points to project viability. The developer can see exactly what moved the needle and why."

*[Text overlay: "Explainable AI — Every change traced to its source"]*

---

## ACT 3 — SMART SCREENER & DEAL DISCOVERY

**[2:30 – 3:20]**

*[Navigate to Smart Screener]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Finding deals shouldn't require navigating a filter panel. The Smart Screener accepts plain English."

*[Click into the search bar. Type slowly:]*
> `Operational solar or wind projects in Southern Europe with equity IRR above 8% and capacity above 30MW`

*[Short pause. Results animate in — four projects with relevance scores.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "The AI reads that query, extracts the intent, and returns ranked results in under a second — drawing on the full text of every project document in the platform, not just headline metadata."

*[Hover over the first result — a panel expands showing the signal score, key financials, geography tag.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Click any result to go directly to the project. Save the search — and the platform will notify you the moment a new project matching these criteria is added."

*[Click "Save Search" — a small confirmation toast appears.]*

*[Text overlay: "Never miss a deal that fits your mandate"]*

---

## ACT 4 — RALPH, THE AI RESEARCH ASSISTANT

**[3:20 – 4:45]**

*[Navigate to the Nordvik Wind Farm II project page. Click the Ralph panel icon in the topbar — the sliding panel opens from the right.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Ralph is SCR's AI research assistant. He can answer complex investment questions by reasoning across every document in the platform — not a generic chatbot, but an analyst who has read everything you've uploaded."

*[Click Ralph's suggested question: "What are the key risks in this project's legal structure?"]*

*[Ralph begins typing. Show the streaming response. After 3 seconds, the answer appears — 4 short paragraphs, each ending with a numbered citation like [1], [2].]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Notice the citations. Every claim Ralph makes is sourced from a specific document. This isn't a hallucination — it's a traceable analysis."

*[Click on citation [1]. The data room opens to the exact page of the legal agreement, highlighting the referenced clause.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Click a citation and the platform takes you directly to the source — the exact paragraph in the original document that Ralph drew from. Every AI output on this platform works this way. You can verify every conclusion."

*[Back to Ralph. Type a new question:]*
> `Compare the equity IRR of this project against similar wind assets in our portfolio`

*[Ralph uses a tool — a subtle "Searching portfolio..." indicator appears briefly, then the response comes with a comparison table.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Ralph has access to 19 specialised tools that give him direct access to platform data — signal scores, portfolio metrics, valuations, carbon credit calculations, legal document analysis. He's not just summarising text; he's computing answers from live data."

*[Text overlay: "RAG-powered — Every answer grounded in your documents"]*

---

## ACT 5 — DATA ROOM & DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE

**[4:45 – 5:45]**

*[Navigate to the Data Room for Adriatic Infrastructure Holdings]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "The data room is where deals live. But unlike a traditional VDR — which is just secure file storage — every document here is actively processed by the platform's AI the moment it's uploaded."

*[Show the folder structure. Click on a financial model XLSX.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "When this financial model was uploaded, the platform automatically classified it as a financial statement, extracted forty-three key metrics — IRR, NPV, DSCR, revenue by year — and made them available for scoring, benchmarking, and Ralph's analysis. No manual tagging. No copy-paste."

*[Navigate to the document detail page. Show the Version History tab — 3 versions, with checksums visible.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Full version control on every document. SHA-256 checksums for integrity verification. And the Access Log shows exactly which investor viewed which version, at what time — the kind of engagement data that tells you whether an LP has actually read the materials before a call."

*[Click the Access Log tab — shows a table of user, timestamp, version, duration.]*

*[Navigate back to the data room root. Click "Redact" on a document.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Before sharing sensitive materials externally, the redaction tool runs an AI scan for sensitive entities — personal data, financial figures, counterparty names. The AI flags every candidate for human review."

*[Show the review interface — highlighted entities with checkboxes. Click "Apply Redactions" on a subset.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Approved redactions are applied. A clean PDF is generated. The original is preserved. The entire decision — who approved what, on which document — is in the audit trail."

---

## ACT 6 — COVENANT MONITORING

**[5:45 – 6:30]**

*[Navigate to Monitoring — show the covenant dashboard for a portfolio]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Portfolio management is only as good as its ability to catch problems early. SCR checks every investment covenant every night."

*[Show a table of covenants — most show green Compliant badges, but one row shows an amber Warning badge: DSCR below 1.25x.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "This project's Debt Service Coverage Ratio dropped below the warning threshold three nights ago. The portfolio manager received an alert the morning it happened — not in the next quarterly report."

*[Click into the covenant detail. Show a trend chart of DSCR over the past six months — a clear downward trend.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "The trend chart shows the deterioration over six months. Without this visibility, this conversation would have happened at the board meeting, not three weeks before the board meeting."

*[Text overlay: "Compliant → Warning → Breach — Daily automated checks"]*

*[Navigate to Benchmarks briefly — show quartile positioning for IRR.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "And every metric is benchmarked. This project's IRR sits at the 68th percentile versus comparable solar assets from the same vintage year. Context that used to require a Bloomberg terminal and a manual data pull — available instantly for any asset in the portfolio."

---

## ACT 7 — LP REPORTING

**[6:30 – 7:30]**

*[Navigate to Reports → LP Reports]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Quarterly LP reporting is the most time-consuming recurring task in fund management. SCR eliminates most of it."

*[Click "Generate Report" — select LP Quarterly template, select the fund, choose format PDF.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Select the template, select the fund, choose the output format. The platform draws from live data — portfolio performance, benchmark positions, covenant status, pacing analysis, ESG scores — and generates the report."

*[A progress indicator runs for 3–4 seconds. Report appears as a preview.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "In under ten seconds, a publication-quality quarterly report. Performance summary, benchmark positioning, ESG metrics, covenant status, cashflow pacing — all compiled automatically."

*[Scroll slowly through the report preview — show the visual quality: charts, tables, professional layout.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "The same report that previously took a two-person analyst team two weeks now takes seconds. It can be scheduled — set it once, and the platform generates and distributes the report automatically every quarter."

*[Click "Schedule" — show the scheduling modal with frequency options.]*

*[Text overlay: "PDF · Excel · PowerPoint — All formats, all automated"]*

---

## ACT 8 — ENTERPRISE & ADMIN

**[7:30 – 8:10]**

*[Navigate to Admin → AI Costs]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "For platform administrators, everything is visible and controllable. The AI cost dashboard shows real-time spend by provider and task type — across every organisation on the platform."

*[Show the cost breakdown table briefly.]*

*[Navigate to Admin → Prompt Templates]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Every AI behaviour is managed through the Prompt Registry. When an analyst needs the investment memo template to emphasise climate risk differently — an admin changes the prompt here. No code. No redeployment. Live in minutes."

*[Navigate to Admin → Feature Flags]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Features can be toggled globally or per organisation — enabling beta access for specific clients, or rolling back a feature without a deployment."

*[Navigate briefly to Settings → Custom Domain — show the custom domain verification interface.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "And for enterprise clients, the platform deploys under their own brand and domain. Their investors see their logo, their colours, their domain name — powered by SCR underneath."

---

## CLOSING

**[8:10 – 8:55]**

*[Navigate back to the main dashboard — full overview visible.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "SCR Platform is not a suite of tools bolted together. It's a single operating system where every component — deal scoring, document intelligence, portfolio monitoring, LP reporting, AI research — shares the same data foundation and reinforces every other."

*[Pan slowly across the dashboard one more time.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "When a document is uploaded, the score updates. When the score changes, the portfolio manager is notified. When the covenant breaches, the LP report already reflects it. When the analyst asks Ralph a question, the answer cites the document that was uploaded this morning."

*[Pause. Screen holds on dashboard.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "Eighty-one application modules. One hundred and seventy-six data models. Five AI providers. Twenty-five automated workflows running every day."

*[Brief pause.]*

**NARRATOR:**
> "This is what AI-native infrastructure investment looks like."

*[Logo fades in centre screen.]*

> **SCR Platform**
> *The AI-Native Operating System for Sustainable Infrastructure Investment*

*[Call to action text fades in below:]*
> **Request a live demo at scr-platform.com**

*[Music fades to silence. Hold logo for 3 seconds. Fade to black.]*

## SUPPLEMENTARY SCENES (Optional — cut-down versions)

These scenes can be added or swapped in for specific audiences or shorter cuts:

### Blockchain Audit Trail (30 seconds)
*[Navigate to Blockchain Audit]*
> "For regulated fund managers, every critical platform event is cryptographically anchored to the Polygon blockchain — providing a tamper-proof, third-party-verifiable record of data integrity. Click any entry to verify the hash directly on PolygonScan."

### Investor Matching (30 seconds)
*[Navigate to Matching]*
> "The Matching module pairs projects with investors whose mandate, geography, and ticket-size preferences align. Match scores are explained — showing which specific criteria drove the recommendation. The warm introductions workflow closes the loop between match and conversation."

### Stress Testing (30 seconds)
*[Navigate to Stress Test]*
> "The Stress Testing module models portfolio performance under defined adverse scenarios — rising interest rates, construction cost overruns, grid curtailment. Portfolio managers see their total exposure quantified before a downturn, not during one."

### Excel Add-in (20 seconds)
*[Show Excel with =SCR.SCORE("helios-solar-iberia") in a cell, returning 74]*
> "The Excel add-in brings live SCR data into financial models. Signal scores, benchmark metrics, IRR figures — all updating automatically in the spreadsheets your team already uses."
